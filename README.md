# Employee Monitoring and Emotion Detection

ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**  
A prototype web application that monitors employee presence via webcam, detects their emotional state, stores the data in a database, and displays results and analytics on a web dashboard.


## Features

1. **Camera Monitoring**
   - Uses OpenCV to detect employee presence via the system webcam.
   - Marks status as **Present** or **Not Present** in real-time.

2. **Emotion Detection**
   - Implements a deep learning model "SiglipForImageClassification" to recognize emotions.
   - Detects the following emotions: **Happy, Sad, Neutral, Angry, Surprise**.

3. **Backend & Database**
   - Stores logs in a database (SQLite by default; can be changed to MySQL/PostgreSQL).

4. **Dashboard (Frontend)**
   - Simple web dashboard using **HTML, CCS and Javascript**.
   - Displays:
     - Live camera preview.
     - Real-time detection results (Presence + Emotion).
     - Analytics: Presence timeline, Emotion distribution charts.

5. **Reports & Analytics**
   - Daily/weekly summaries:
     - Percentage of time present.
     - Most frequent emotion.
